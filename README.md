# üêë Two Sheep Cheat - Catan Resource Tracker

*"Knowledge is power, and in Catan, knowing your opponent's resources is... well, let's just say it's not exactly playing by the spirit of the game"* üòè

## What This Is

A browser extension that tracks your opponents' resources in Catan by analyzing the public chat log. It's like having a photographic memory for every trade, build, and resource exchange that happens in the game.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The "Cheating" Disclaimer

Look, we're not going to sugarcoat this - this extension gives you information that would normally require you to pay very close attention and do mental math throughout the entire game. It's technically "cheating" in the sense that it makes something that's theoretically possible manually much easier to do automatically.

**But here's the thing:** All the information it shows you is publicly available in the game's chat log. You could literally sit there with a pen and paper and calculate the same results. This just saves you the trouble of being that person who's frantically scribbling notes while everyone else is having fun.

## How It Works

1. **Install the extension** (instructions below)
2. **Play Catan** on your favorite platform
3. **Click the extension icon** whenever you want to see updated resource counts
4. **Profit** (metaphorically speaking)

The extension parses the chat log to track:
- Resource trades between players
- Building actions (roads, settlements, cities)
- Development card purchases
- Resource discards (when you have too many cards)
- Robber steals

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome/Edge and go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" (top right toggle)
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `catanbot` folder
5. The extension should now appear in your toolbar

## Usage

- **Click the extension icon** (the cute sheep) to see current resource counts
- **Click again** to refresh the data
- The extension will show you a breakdown of each player's current resources

## Technical Notes

- Works by analyzing the publicly available chat log
- Updates are manual (click to refresh)
- No data is stored or transmitted anywhere
- All calculations happen locally in your browser

## Why "Two Sheep Cheat"?

Because sometimes you just need to know if your opponent actually has those two sheep they're offering in trade, or if they're bluffing. And let's be honest - we've all been there.

## Legal-ish Stuff

This extension only reads information that's already publicly visible in the game. It doesn't:
- Modify the game files
- Interfere with game mechanics
- Give you resources you shouldn't have
- Access any private or hidden information

## Final Thoughts

Remember: The best Catan players don't just have good strategies - they have good information. Whether you use this extension or not, the real skill is in knowing how to use that information to your advantage.

*"May your roads be long, your settlements be prosperous, and your opponents be... well, let's just say they'll never know what hit them."* üè∞

*Built with love and a slightly guilty conscience by someone who definitely doesn't use this in their own games... much.*
